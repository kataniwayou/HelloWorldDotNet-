# Progress: HelloWorldDotNet (Initialization)

## 1. What Works

*   The basic .NET console application structure is in place (`.csproj`, `Program.cs`).
*   The application compiles and runs successfully via `dotnet run`.
*   The application prints the expected "Hello [Name] World!" output.
*   Initial project files are committed to Git.
*   The `.clinerules` file defining interaction guidelines is created.
*   The `memory-bank` directory structure is created.
*   Core memory bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`) are created with initial content.

## 2. What's Left to Build

*   This `progress.md` file is being created now.
*   Commit the newly created `.clinerules` and `memory-bank` files to Git.
*   Modified `Program.cs` to add a second message ("my demo is working").
*   Verified the output by running the demo.
*   Committed the changes to Git.
*   Added a seconds counter that counts down from 60 to 0 and waits for user input.
*   Verified the counter and termination by running the demo.
*   Committed the changes to Git.
*   Modified `Program.cs` to display the seconds counter in a single line using carriage return.
*   Verified the single-line counter display by running the demo.
*   Committed the changes to Git.
*   No further functional development is planned for this simple project unless requested.

## 3. Current Status

*   **Overall:** Project baseline established, memory bank initialization in progress.
*   **Functionality:** Complete (as per initial scope).
*   **Documentation:** Memory bank core files are being created.

## 4. Known Issues

*   None currently identified.

## 5. Evolution of Project Decisions

*   Initial project created using standard `dotnet new console`.
*   `.clinerules` file added to guide AI interaction.
*   Memory bank system implemented as per user's custom instructions to provide persistent context for Cline.
