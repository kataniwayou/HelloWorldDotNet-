# Product Context: HelloWorldDotNet

## 1. Problem Solved

*   This project serves as a minimal, runnable example of a .NET console application. It doesn't solve a specific user problem but acts as a foundational template or testbed.

## 2. How It Works

*   The application consists of a single `Program.cs` file.
*   When executed via `dotnet run`, it prints a hardcoded greeting "Hello [Name] World!" to the standard output console.

## 3. User Experience Goals

*   **Simplicity:** The project should be extremely easy to understand, build, and run.
*   **Clarity:** The code should be self-explanatory.
